# SideWorld

Project created by Joaquin Quiroga and Yangli Liu

The problem we are trying to solve:
As human relationships drift towards the digital realm they become detached from real world spaces, making people feel disconnected from their own surroundings and losing the rich contextual meaning they provide.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

### `npm run eject`
